# Website

## Live Equation Editor
- Drag an image of your handwritten or digital equations to have them be instantly converted to TeX code and rendered on the site
- The TeX code can be easily edited; the equations will dynamically render on the page
- Use the buttons below to automatically open Symbolab/Wolfram in a new tab, passing in your equation as an input

#### API Usage
- The Live Equation Editor uses the MathPix API to perform OCR on equation images
- The KaTeX typesetting library is used to render the TeX code

# Backend Features

## Delta Epsilon Proofs
![](/imgs/open10.png)
* Structure your own Delta Epsilon proof in LaTeX
* Allows you to set delta and add expressions to your proof (it'll only add them if the current expression and its previous one makes sense).
* Set epsilon to create a visualization of the proof.

## CFGs
* Check if your string can be generated by the given context-free grammar. 

## Automatas (PDAs, DFSAs, NFSAs)
* Check if your string is accepted by the given DFSA and show the steps on how DFSA accept/reject the string. 
* Check if your string is accepted by the given NFSA and list all the states that can be reached. 
* Check if your string is accepted by the given PDA and list all states and stacks that can be reached. 

## Logical Equivalencies
* Given a predicate, you can
  * Convert to CNF
  * Convert to DNF
  * Generate a Truth Table
  * Create a Parse Tree

## Computations
* Checks if one expression is equivalent to the other.
